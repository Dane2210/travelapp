Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Title: Travel App
Description:
The Travel App is a mobile-first platform that helps users plan budget-friendly trips by comparing flights, hotels, and activities. It offers real-time price tracking, total trip cost estimation, and a community feature where users can share their travel experiences through posts and ratings. The app prioritizes affordability, transparency, and simplicity-especially for students, frequent travelers, and first-time planners.

- APIs:
Travel data (flights/hotels): External APIs (e.g., Skyscanner, Google Flights)
Geolocation & currency conversion (optional): RapidAPI, GeoDB
Database
- Platform: Firebase (Firestore for user data, preferences, posts, and alerts)
- Authentication: Firebase Auth (Email/password)
Hosting / CI
- Firebase Hosting for frontend
- GitHub Pages or Netlify for documentation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)

Technical Constraints
• MVP must exclude:

• AI-powered predictions or travel recommendations
• SMS notifications or biometric login

• Save and share filters with friends
• Trending destination feed
• Social features (followers, likes, messaging)

Success Criteria
• Users can search for and view flight/hotel options
• Alerts and trip cost estimator function without error
• Posts can be created, approved, and viewed in-app
• UI is minimal, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate
• GitHub + Windsurf project workspace is clean and functional
